  I am going to be talking about how to stop bullying. Many people get bullied and it is not a fun aspect in your life.
  I got bullied when I was in middle school and that was a tough time in my life. No one should
  get bullied because it just makes other lives worse. If someone is bullying you then you have to tell a
  teacher,principal or before you do any of that you tell them to stop and that you dont want to be
  treated that way and if they dont stop then tell the chaperones.
